            <h2 p style=" color:#ffffff"">Here are some of my favorites leadership lessons from Star Wars.</h2>
            <ol>
                <h3 p style="color:#ffffff"">Never tell me the odds. - " Han-Solo"</h3>
                    <li p style="color:#ffffff""> is a memorable quote said by Han Solo. It was used as a reply to C-3PO telling Han the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field, which, by the way, was very low.

                    It can also be used as a reaction image to reply to something telling you how hard something is, or what your chances of doing something are.</li>
   
                    <br>
                    <h3 p style=" color:#ffffff"">Your focus determines your reality. - Qui-Gon Jinn.
                </h3>
                <li p style="color:#ffffff"">This is perhaps my favorite quote from all of Star Wars and is a rule I live by. Two people witness the exact same event, yet when they talk about what they saw, they describe two entirely different events. You slap one person they will hit back, but when you hit another person, they shrug it off and ‘turn the other cheek,’ or when it rains, some complain while others are happy at nature renewing herself. How you interpret life defines the type of life you live.

                    When Anakin began whining about Padme in Attack of the Clones, Obi-Wan warns Anakin he if focusing on the negative and that he should be mindful of his feelings. He is about to see the love of his life, but instead of being happy, he calls up the negatives. If people focused more on the positives in life, it would be a lot harder for the dark times to take hold.</li>
                    <br>

                    <h3 p style=" color:#ffffff"">You can’t stop the change. Any more than you can stop the suns from
                    setting. - Shmi Skywalker</h3>
                <li p style="color:#ffffff""> This one gets lost in the movie. It’s a quick little scene, but leaves a quote that is very powerful. Anakin just realized his dream! He gets to leave slavery and become he very thing he dreams of becoming, but when it is time for the foot to hit the pavement, he chokes. He gives into his fears.

                    How often do we do that? Something glorious lays before us; The very thing we desire, yet when it is time to put up or shut up, we choke or hesitate. Luckily, Anakin had his mother there to set him straight. Change comes whether we like it or not.

                    Shmi ends the scene a bit later with the perfect follow up quote “Now be brave and don’t look back. Don’t look back.”</li>
